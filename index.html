                        <h2>About us</h2>
                        <p>Senior citizens are one of the most respected people who also matter the most to us. They may be our grandparents, 
                            someone you see in the park sitting on a bench, someone you help to cross the road, or just someone to whom you go
                            to feel at home. Their love for us never reduces no matter what we do, but due to multiple different reasons, a lot of
                            them sometimes do not have a decent place to live or enough earnings/ a support system to rely on and that's where we come in.
                            We are an NGO working towards the betterment of Senior Citizens by helping them with financial aid, health services, 
                            recreational facilities to get through the day, and just lots of friends like each other to sit and gossip or have a drink with. 
                            We also provide them with small employment opportunities if they are willing to work/ want to work, without too much workload or 
                            stress. We try to provide them with a stress-free, lively, and comfortable environment for them to spend their retirement age in the 
                            most beautiful way.

                        <p>Started in 2017, we are now a 3-year-old NGO currently inhabiting over 100 senior citizens, making them smile. We started this NGO during
                            our college years when we got really disheartened seeing a lot of senior citizens not having proper facilities to spend their retirement 
                            years properly and this sight gave us the motivation to do something for the most loving people of the society. We have been given funding 
                            from a few companies, and a lot of help has come in different various forms of donation, which now has made our NGO a very beautiful place 
                            to love in.
